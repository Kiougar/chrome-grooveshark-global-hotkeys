DESCRIPTION: Enable global hot-keys for Grooveshark

Based on the work from Julian Xhokaxhiu (https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/chrome-grooveshark-mediakeys-reloaded)

HOW IT WORKS:
Just press play/pause, prev or next buttons and it will trigger the corresponding buttons for the webpage.
There are also some predefined hot-keys to Favorite and Like songs:

	Ctrl+Shift+7 -> Remove from Favorites
	Ctrl+Shift+8 -> Remove from Collection
	Ctrl+Shift+9 -> Add to Favorites
	Ctrl+Shift+0 -> Add to Collection

Hotkeys also work when chrome is in background.

Enjoy!
